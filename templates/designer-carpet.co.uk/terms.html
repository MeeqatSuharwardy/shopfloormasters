<h2>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS </h2>

<h3>1. These terms</h3>
<p><strong>1.1	What these terms cover.</strong> These are the terms and conditions on which we supply goods to you.</p>

<p><strong>1.2	Why you should read them.</strong> Please read these terms carefully before you submit your order to us. These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide gods to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these terms, please contact us to discuss.</p>

<h3>2. Information about us and how to contact us</h3>
<p><strong>2.1	Who we are.</strong> We are a Designer Carpets &amp; Remnants LTD, a company registered in England and Wales. Our company registration number is 07636873 and our registered office is at 7 Taplow Close, Mickleover, Derby, DE3 0RP.</p>

<p><strong>2.2	How to contact us.</strong> You can contact us by telephoning our customer service team at 01332 346444 or by writing to us at <a href="mailto:info@designer-carpet.co.uk" rel="nofollow">info@designer-carpet.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.3	How we may contact you.</strong> If we have to contact you we will do so by telephone or by writing to you at the email address or postal address you provided to us in your order.</p>

<p><strong>2.4	"Writing" includes emails.</strong> When we use the words "writing" or "written" in these terms, this includes emails.</p>

<h3>3. Our contract with you</h3>

<p><strong>3.1	Order process.</strong> When placing an order online, please follow the onscreen prompts to place the order. When placing an order over the phone, we will raise a quote following receipt of your enquiry and confirm the order with you. Each order is an offer by you to buy the goods specified in the order subject to these terms and conditions.</p>

<p><strong>3.2	How we will accept your order.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 3.3 below, our acceptance of your order will take place when we email you to confirm acceptance of it, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us. Please note an emailing confirming “receipt” of your order is not the same as us confirming acceptance – we will check our stock levels after confirming receipt of your order.</p>

<p><strong>3.3	If we cannot accept your order.</strong> If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the goods. This might be because the goods are out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the goods or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.</p>

<p><strong>3.4	Your order number.</strong> We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.</p>

<h3>4. Our goods</h3>

<p><strong>4.1	Goods may vary slightly from their pictures and colour tolerance.</strong> The images of goods on our website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that a device's display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the goods. Your goods may vary slightly from those images. Please note that where the goods are natural products, variations in weave, shade and colour of the goods cannot be avoided and will certainly vary from product to product, batch to batch.</p>

<p><strong>4.2	Packaging of goods may vary.</strong> The packaging of the goods may vary from that shown in images on our website.</p>

<p><strong>4.3	Samples and incorrect colours.</strong> We strongly recommend that you order a sample swatch before purchasing any goods to reduce the possibility of a mismatch scenario. However, we do not guarantee that the product you receive will be as exactly the same as the sample ordered (as stated in clause 4.1 above). We offer 4 samples of carpet free of charge. Please note it is your full and sole responsibility to inspect the colour of any goods that you order and to ensure the colour meets your requirements. Where the goods are cut to size, but do not meet your colour requirements, we unfortunately cannot accept a return of such goods or offer a refund for them (unless we are at fault in shipping the wrong coloured item). Where the goods have not been cut to size, and do not meet your colour requirements, then provided you have not altered the goods in any way or fitted them, you have the right to return the goods to us, for a refund, provided always that such return is made within 14 days of the goods being delivered to you.</p>

<p><strong>4.4	Making sure your measurements are accurate.</strong> If we are making the goods to measurements you have given us and/or cutting them to size, then you are responsible for ensuring that these measurements are correct. You can find information and tips on how to measure <a href="faq/measuring-fitting.html">on our website</a> or by contacting us.</p>

<h3>5. Your rights to make changes</h3>

<p>If you wish to make a change to the goods you have ordered please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the goods, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change. If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are unacceptable to you, you may want to end the contract (see clause 8).</p>

<h3>6. Our rights to make changes</h3>

<p><strong>6.1	Minor changes to the goods.</strong> We may change the goods:<br/><br/>
(a)	to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and <br/><br/>
(b)	to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements.<br/><br/>
We also reserve the right to add or remove from our range of products, at any time.</p>

<h3>7. Providing the goods</h3>

<p><strong>7.1	Delivery costs.</strong> The costs of delivery will be as displayed to you on our website. There are some areas/addresses that we are unable to deliver to and some addresses/post codes may incur a surcharge. These will be notified to you during the order process once you have provided the intended delivery address.</p>

<p><strong>7.2	When we will provide the goods.</strong> During the order process we will let you know when we will provide the goods to you and give you the option to choose an estimated delivery date. Where the goods are out of stock we will contact you to discuss delivery timescales. Delivery dates are estimates only and we cannot guarantee delivery on a particular date.</p>

<p><strong>7.3	We are not responsible for delays outside our control.</strong> If our supply of the goods is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any goods you have paid for but not received.</p>

<p><strong>7.4	If you are not at home when the goods are delivered.</strong> If no one is available at your address to take delivery, we will leave you a note informing you of how to rearrange delivery and charge you for the costs of the failed delivery attempt and any subsequent redelivery.</p>

<p><strong>7.5	If you do not re-arrange delivery.</strong> If after a failed delivery to you, you do not re-arrange delivery we will contact you for further instructions and may charge you for storage costs, insurance costs and any further delivery costs. If, despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to contact you or re-arrange delivery within three months of our first delivery attempt, we may end the contract and clause 10.2 will apply.</p>

<p><strong>7.6	Kerb-side deliveries.</strong> All deliveries are operated on a kerbside basis – we shall leave the goods at the nearest access point available to the intended address and you will be required to collect the goods from there.</p>

<p><strong>7.7	When you become responsible for the goods.</strong> The goods will be your responsibility from the time we deliver them to you.</p>

<p><strong>7.8	When you own goods.</strong> You own the goods once we have received payment in full for them.</p>

<p><strong>7.9	What will happen if you do not give required information to us.</strong> We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the goods to you, for example, any access restrictions that apply at your delivery location. We will contact you to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (and clause 10.2 will apply) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the goods late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p>

<h3>8. Your rights to end the contract</h3>

<p><strong>8.1	You can always end your contract with us.</strong> Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:<br/><br/>
(a)	If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the goods repaired or replaced or to get some or all of your money back), see clause 11;<br/>
(b)	If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 8.2; or<br/><br/>
(c)	If you have just changed your mind about the goods see clause 8.3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods.</p>

<p><strong>8.2 Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do.</strong> If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (d) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any goods which have not been provided. The reasons are:<br/><br/>
(a)	we have told you about an upcoming change to the goods or these terms which you do not agree to;<br/><br/>
(b)	we have told you about an error in the price or description of the goods you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;<br/><br/>
(c)	there is a risk that supply of the goods may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control; <br/><br/>
(d)	you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p>

<p><strong>8.3	Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013).</strong> For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund. These rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 are explained in further details in these terms and conditions.</p>

<p><strong>8.4	When you don't have the right to change your mind.</strong>  You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of any goods that have been cut to size or made to your measurements (including, without limitation, any bespoke rugs).</p>

<p><strong>8.5	How long do I have to change my mind?</strong> You have 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the goods, unless your goods are split into several deliveries over different days. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the last delivery to change your mind about the goods.</p>

<h3>9. How to end the contract with us</h3>

<p><strong>9.1	Tell us you want to end the contract.</strong> To end the contract with us, please let us know by doing one of the following:<br/><br/>
(a)	Phone or email. Call customer services on 01332 346444 or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@designer-carpet.co.uk" rel="nofollow">info@designer-carpet.co.uk</a>. Please provide your name, home address, details of the order and, where available, your phone number and email address.<br/><br/>
(b)	By post. Write to us Designer Carpet, Unit 10, Belfield St, Ilkeston, DE7 8DU, including details of what you bought, when you ordered or received it and your name and address. </p>

<p><strong>9.2	Returning goods after ending the contract.</strong> If you end the contract for any reason after goods have been dispatched to you or you have received them, you must return them to us. You must either post the goods back to us at Designer Carpet, Unit 10, Belfield St, Ilkeston, DE7 8DU or (if they are not suitable for posting) allow us to collect them from you. Please call customer services on 01332 346444 or email us at <a href="mailto:info@designer-carpet.co.uk" rel="nofollow">info@designer-carpet.co.uk</a> for a return label or to arrange collection. If you are exercising your right to change your mind you must send off the goods within 14 days of telling us you wish to end the contract. </p>

<p><strong>9.3	When we will pay the costs of return.</strong> We will pay the costs of return:<br/><br/>
(a)	if the goods are faulty or misdescribed;<br/><br/>
(b)	if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the goods or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong.<br/><br/>
In all other circumstances (including where you are exercising your right to change your mind) you must pay the costs of return. </p>  

<p><strong>9.4	What we charge for collection.</strong> If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the goods from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection. </p>

<p><strong>9.5	How we will refund you.</strong> We will refund you the price you paid for the goods by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>9.6	Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind.</strong> If you are exercising your right to change your mind, we may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount. </p>

<p><strong>9.7	When your refund will be made.</strong> We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible.  If you are exercising your right to change your mind then your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the goods back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the goods back to us. </p>

<h3>10.	Our rights to end the contract</h3>

<p><strong>10.1	We may end the contract if you break it.</strong> We may end the contract at any time by writing to you if:<br/><br/>
(a)	you do not make any payment to us when it is due and you still do not make payment within 5 days of us reminding you that payment is due;<br/><br/>
(b)	you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the goods; or<br/><br/>
(c)	you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the goods to you.</p>

<p><strong>10.2	You must compensate us if you break the contract.</strong> If we end the contract in the situations set out in clause 10.1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for goods we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.</p>

<h3>11.	If there is a problem with the goods</h3>

<p><strong>11.1	Inspecting the goods.</strong> All deliveries must be inspected upon receipt and any damage or other discrepancy noted on delivery must be notified immediately to the carrier. You must also ensure that the goods are thoroughly inspected before cutting and/or installing of them. If any defects are found, you must notify us immediately (and in any event, within 5 days of taking delivery of the goods). If you fail to provide such notice, you are deemed to have accepted the goods as being compliant, in all respects, with the terms of the order and our contract. Please note that any goods that have been cut, modified or installed cannot be returned to us. We will also not accept any liability or responsibility for any folding or crease marks in the goods that result from the removal of the pole and/or bending of the goods. Any items missing from an order must be notified to us within three days of the intended delivery date. </p>

<p><strong>11.2	How to tell us about problems.</strong> If you have any questions or complaints about the goods, please contact us. You can telephone our customer service team at 01332 346444 or write to us at <a href="mailto:info@designer-carpet.co.uk" rel="nofollow">info@designer-carpet.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>11.3	Summary of your legal rights.</strong> We are under a legal duty to supply goods that are in conformity with this contract. Nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights.</p>

<p><strong>11.4	Replacements.</strong> Please note that whilst we will endeavour to replace any goods that are defective, this cannot be promised where the goods are remnants, out of stock or discontinued. In such circumstances, we will provide you with a refund or discuss alternative options with you. </p>

<h3>12.	Price and payment</h3>

<p><strong>12.1	Where to find the price for the goods.</strong> The price of the goods (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of the goods advised to you is correct. However please see clause 12.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price. </p>
    
<p><strong>12.2	We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT.</strong> If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the goods, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the goods in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p>
    
<p><strong>12.3	What happens if we got the price wrong.</strong> It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the goods we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the good’s correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the good’s correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.</p>
    
<p><strong>12.4	Import costs.</strong> Please note you are responsible for baring the costs of any import duties, custom duties and all other taxes and duties payable and the cost of obtaining certificates of origin export licenses consular fees and any other documents required for the purposes of exportation or importation or the passage of the goods in transit through any country.</p>
    
<p><strong>12.5	When you must pay and how you must pay.</strong> We accept payment with Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, JCB and via PayPal. You may also make payment via BACs or faster payment, by contacting us to make the payment. You must pay for the goods before we dispatch them. A deposit payment may be required for items which are to be forwarded to our suppliers for rug binding and also for orders where goods are to be stored in our warehouses before dispatch.</p>

<h3>13.	Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</h3>
    
<p><strong>13.1	We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us.</strong> If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable or any indirect or consequential loss. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.</p>
    
<p><strong>13.2	We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.</strong> This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for liability which cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law.</p>
    
<p><strong>13.3	Where we are not liable.</strong> We shall not be liable for any loss arising directly or indirectly out of any of the following:<br/><br/>
(a)	any defects in the goods that were known or ought to have been known by you prior to the goods being fitted or installed; <br/><br/>
(b)	faulty installation, laying, fixing or fitting of the goods;<br/><br/>
(c)	laying the goods on uneven surfaces;<br/><br/>
(d)	cleaning and/or maintenance of the goods;<br/><br/>
(e)	fading of the goods;<br/><br/>
(f)	infestation of the goods by insects, moths, vermin, beetles, weevils, fungus and/or mould;<br/><br/>
(g)	damage caused by you moving or otherwise dealing with the goods;<br/><br/>
(h)	normal wear and tear of the goods.</p>

<p><strong>13.4	We are not liable for business losses.</strong> We only supply the goods for domestic and private use. If you use the goods for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>

<h3>14.	How we may use your personal information</h3>

<p><strong>14.1	How we may use your personal information.</strong>  We will only use your personal information as set out in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>15.	Other important terms</h3>
<p><strong>15.1	We may transfer this agreement to someone else.</strong> We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation.</p>
    
<p><strong>15.2	You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else.</strong> You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</p>
    
<p><strong>15.3	Nobody else has any rights under this contract.</strong> This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</p>

<p><strong>15.4	If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.</strong> Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p><strong>15.5	Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.</strong> If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</p>

<p><strong>15.6	Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.</strong> These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.</p>

		“The Seller” DESIGNER CARPET & REMNANTS LTD <br>
		“The Buyer’. The person or firm or company to whom the Goods are supplied under the Contract <br>
		“The Goods” shall mean the products and services referred to in the Seller’s order, order acknowledgement or invoices. <br>
		“The Order” shall mean the Order placed by the Buyer to the Seller in respect of Goods whether received in writing, by telephone, email, or in person. <br>    
		“The Contract” The Contract for the supply of Goods by the Seller to the Buyer comprising these Terms and Conditions.  <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>2. Inspection and Notice.</b><br>
		All deliveries should be inspected upon receipt and any damage or other discrepancy noted on delivery must be notified immediately to the carrier.  Otherwise the Buyer shall, before the Goods are cut and/or installed, fully inspect the Goods and give notice to the Seller of any matter where she/he alleges that the goods are not in accordance with the contract, within five days of taking delivery. If the Buyer fails to give such notice, the Goods shall be deemed to be in all respects in accord with the contract and the Buyer shall be bound to accept and pay for the same accordingly. Cut or installed Goods cannot be returned. Non-delivery must be notified to the Seller within three days of the delivery date. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>3. Price.  </b><br>
		Order confirmation sent to the Buyer indicates that an order is received, not that a contract exists between a Buyer and Seller. The Seller will indicate acceptance of the Buyer’s order and hence a contract when the Seller sends an invoice. This condition is included to protect against pricing errors or to guard against the Seller’s suppliers being unable to satisfy an order. In the case of a change of price, the Seller shall contact the Buyer to ensure that the price is agreeable. The Seller may increase the price of the Goods to take account of any increase in the cost of materials, labour or other factors affecting the cost to the Seller of producing or delivering the Goods which occurs before the date of delivery. Prices quoted on the web site include VAT at the current rate but are subject to a subsidised delivery charge. Quoted prices do not form part of a legally binding contract until the Seller’s acceptance of the Buyer’s order.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>4. Colour Tolerance.</b><br>
		Despite being a rare scenario, the colour of your good(s) can vary slightly in comparison to the product image shown online, or the ordered sample swatch.  The Seller strongly recommends a sample swatch to be ordered before the purchase of your good(s) since that reduces the possibility of a mismatch scenario; however this does not eliminate the possibility of such a situation.  It is the Buyer’s responsibility to inspect the colour, when the carpet is delivered and before it is fitted and/or altered in any way, to confirm they are happy with the colour.  In the case of a mismatch scenario, the Buyer must inform the Seller within 10 working days from the date of the delivery.  If the colour mismatch is noticed after the goods have been altered in any way then no refund or compensation should be expected from the Seller. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>4. Duties and Taxes. </b><br> 
		The Buyer shall bear the cost of VAT import duties custom duties all other taxes and duties payable and the cost of obtaining certificates of origin export licenses consular fees and any other documents required for the purposes of exportation or importation or the passage of the Goods in transit through any country. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>5. Administrative Expenses.</b><br>
		The Seller may add such administrative charges it thinks fit to the price of the Goods to cover the additional costs to the Seller of delivering a small quantity of Goods. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>6. Time of Delivery.  </b><br>
		The Seller will endeavour to meet any times given by the Buyer for the delivery of Goods but any dates given by the Seller are estimates only and the Seller shall not be liable for any loss damage or expense suffered by the Buyer by reason (whether directly or indirectly) of the Seller’s failure to meet any date estimated. </p> 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> 7. Force Majeure.  </b><br>
		7.1. The Seller shall not be liable if the supply of Goods is hindered or delayed by reason at strikes, sit-ins, trade disputes, lock-outs or any other actual or threatened industrial action, by difficulty in obtaining labour or raw materials or by break-down of plant and machinery (including transport) or by interruption of power supplies or by fire or legal action by any third party (whether or not any of the aforesaid was caused by the negligence  of the Seller its servants or agents) or by reason of any circumstances outside the Seller’s control which shall include but not be limited to war of a civil nature or against foreign enemies, intervention by any government department council or duly constituted authority and all other cases of force majeure. <br>
		7.2. If the manufacture or delivery of the full quantity of the Goods hereunder is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of any of the circumstances within Clause 7.1 then without prejudice to the exemption from liability under Clause 7.1 the Seller shall be entitled to apportion the Goods at its discretion between the Buyer and Other customers of the Seller and to deliver the quantity so apportioned to the Buyer until such time as the full quantity of the Goods can be and is delivered hereunder. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>8. Description, Sample, Quality and Fitness.  </b><br>
		8.1. The descriptions applied to the Goods are given for purposes of identification only and the use of such   description shall not constitute a sale by description. <br>
		8.2 We recommend that the Buyer should see a sample of any product which they wish to purchase, before any order is made. Although we make every effort to ensure our products are accurately reflected in our on-line images, monitor and screen settings can vary which cause the products’ colours to appear differently. We are happy to send samples of all of our products. <br>
		8.2.1 The sample of the Goods shown to the Buyer was solely to enable the Buyer to judge the quality of the bulk and not so as to constitute a sale by sample. The Buyer shall take the Goods at its own risk as to their   corresponding with the said sample or as to their quality, condition or sufficiency for any purpose. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>9. Liability. </b><br>  
		9.1. The following provisions set out the Seller’s entire liability to the Buyer in respect of: <br>

		9.3.2. In all other cases the Seller’s liability shall be limited to the price of the Goods.<br>
		9.4. The Seller shall not in any event be liable to the Buyer for loss of profits, goodwill or any type of special indirect or consequential loss (including loss or damage suffered by the Buyer as a result of an action brought by a third party) even if such loss was reasonably foreseeable or the Seller had been advised of the possibility of the Buyer incurring the same.<br>
		9.5. The Seller shall not be liable for any loss arising directly or indirectly out of any of the following: <br>
		9.5.1. The fitting or installation of the Goods by or on behalf of the Buyer if the Buyer was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware of any fault or defect in the Goods;<br>
		9.5.2. faulty installation, laying, fixing or fitting of the Goods;<br>
		9.5.3. laying the Goods on uneven surfaces;<br>

		9.7. No claims whatsoever will be entertained and no liability accepted by the Seller in any event for Goods sold at discount prices as remnants or as sub-standard stock.<br>
		9.8. No claims whatsoever will be entertained and no liability accepted by the Seller where the Goods have   been cut or laid.<br>
		9.9 Where the Goods are sold under a consumer Transaction (as defined in the Consumer Transactions   (Restrictions on Statement) Order 1976) the statutory rights of the Buyer are not affected by these conditions.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>10. Payment.</b><br>

		12.4. The Buyer’s right to possession of the Goods shall cease if he being an individual commits an available   act of bankruptcy or if it being a limited company does anything or fails to do anything which will entitle a   Receiver to take possession of any assets or which would entitle any person to present a petition for its winding up. The Seller may for the purpose of recovering the Goods enter upon any premises where they are stored or where the Seller reasonably believes them to be stored and may repossess the same.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>13. Storage. </b><br> 
		13.1. The Buyer shall take delivery of the Goods within the period or by the date named in the Contract and where for any reason the Buyer is unable to accept delivery of the Goods (Or any part thereof) at any time when the Goods are due and ready for delivery the Seller shall (if its storage facilities permit) at the Buyer’s risk store the Goods (or any part thereof) and the Buyer shall be liable to the Seller for the reasonable costs (including insurance) of so doing. Such payment shall be in addition to any other costs, payments or damages for which the Buyer may become liable in respect of its failure to take delivery on the due date.<br>
		13.2. Where the Buyer fails to take delivery of the Goods for a period in excess of six months whether the Goods be paid for or not, the Seller without prejudice to its general rights in law reserves the right to treat the Contract as repudiated by the Buyer and the right to re-sell the Goods. The Buyer will receive a refund if appropriate after deduction by the Seller of all costs incurred and losses occasioned as a result of the Buyer’s non-acceptance.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>14. Termination.  </b><br>
		14.1. The Contract shall automatically terminate if the Buyer (being an individual or in the case of a firm a   member thereof) commits any act of bankruptcy or has a receiving order made against him or has any process of distress or execution levied against his goods and makes any arrangement with his creditors before the property in The Goods has passed to the Buyer hereunder.<br>
		14.2.

		14.3. Upon termination of the Contract the Seller shall be entitled to recover payments for all Goods supplied and for the costs of materials and labour already expended by the Seller for the purpose of future deliveries of Goods and to recover from the Buyer a sum equivalent to the Seller’s loss of profit arising out of such termination (which sum shall be certified by the Seller and notified to the Buyer whereupon it shall be final and binding upon the parties).<br>

		Nothing in the Seller’s published information shall be deemed an offer and the Seller reserves the right to   accept or refuse any order.</p>
